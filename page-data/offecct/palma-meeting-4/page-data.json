Palma Meeting is a development of the Palma lounge chair. Palma Meeting is a graceful, playful chair, developed with both the conference room and the home environment in mind. Palma Meeting is inspired by the cupped palm of a hand, symbolically cradling the body that sits in it. The chair's elegant form is captured in the seat, backrest and armrests as a single graceful movement. With its frame of molded birch veneer and seamless upholstery, Palma features an extremely elegant design. Above all, Khodi Feiz and Offecct have endeavored to develop a chair with a long lifespan. It must be able to withstand wear and remain appealing to the eye. The chair is clearly informal. Feiz would like to see it used in the home as well as in a professional conference room.   \n  \n“Palma is a chair to investigate and enjoy. When a child crawls up into the chair, it’s entirely different from when an adult gets into it. Children throw their feet up and cling to it in a way we adults do not”, says designer Khodi Feiz.   \n  ","designer":"Khodi Feiz","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"5365188f-8424-4048-9c8e-f11960503093","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/37fca94bb4bb5baa168c804b3eeafb5c/02dff/PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-122180-10110.jpg","srcSet":"/static/37fca94bb4bb5baa168c804b3eeafb5c/0fdf4/PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-122180-10110.jpg 300w,\n/static/37fca94bb4bb5baa168c804b3eeafb5c/a89ca/PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-122180-10110.jpg 600w,\n/static/37fca94bb4bb5baa168c804b3eeafb5c/02dff/PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-122180-10110.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/37fca94bb4bb5baa168c804b3eeafb5c/078c3/PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-122180-10110.webp 300w,\n/static/37fca94bb4bb5baa168c804b3eeafb5c/6d09e/PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-122180-10110.webp 600w,\n/static/37fca94bb4bb5baa168c804b3eeafb5c/83805/PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-122180-10110.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1200}}}},"image_secondary":{"id":"dbb0a720-dec5-4b9a-ac45-ef667256b0c3","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#585858","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/287fa653e94d341364e0f050d69da512/02dff/SELECTED-PATTERNSTM-PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-9267.jpg","srcSet":"/static/287fa653e94d341364e0f050d69da512/0fdf4/SELECTED-PATTERNSTM-PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-9267.jpg 300w,\n/static/287fa653e94d341364e0f050d69da512/a89ca/SELECTED-PATTERNSTM-PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-9267.jpg 600w,\n/static/287fa653e94d341364e0f050d69da512/02dff/SELECTED-PATTERNSTM-PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-9267.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/287fa653e94d341364e0f050d69da512/078c3/SELECTED-PATTERNSTM-PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-9267.webp 300w,\n/static/287fa653e94d341364e0f050d69da512/6d09e/SELECTED-PATTERNSTM-PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-9267.webp 600w,\n/static/287fa653e94d341364e0f050d69da512/83805/SELECTED-PATTERNSTM-PALMA-MEETING-Chairs-Khodi-Feiz-offecct-9267.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1200}}}},"tags":["Chairs"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Offecct","slug":"offecct","image_logo_dark":{"id":"cf96e4ad-cc9c-4d9d-b4fc-2a9dfe5b9d07","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/003fc2532a8b8ba2fe72440a434552df/dark_offecct.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2895"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2823708677"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
