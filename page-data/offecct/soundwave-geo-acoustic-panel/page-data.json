Ineke Hans views Soundwave® Geo as a three-dimensional wall decoration similar to the ones which people have always created around the world. The difference is that Geo has a clear function due to its sound-absorbing purpose.  \n  \n“People have always wanted to decorate their walls – everywhere and in every era. But we designers have a tendency to pare away the decorative aspect. I wanted to combine Offecct’s sound panels made of felt with a geometric pattern that is decorative but can also function on the large scale with many panels in rows without looking too cluttered. Quite simply, a combination of tradition and modern design,” says Ineke Hans.   \n  ","designer":"Ineke Hans","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"8d75a5e4-514c-421f-99e8-807856791012","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#489898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a014788b5837e0ecda1d6e173d4bf6a4/722ed/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-19-2831.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a014788b5837e0ecda1d6e173d4bf6a4/4e8ca/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-19-2831.jpg 291w,\n/static/a014788b5837e0ecda1d6e173d4bf6a4/de8ca/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-19-2831.jpg 582w,\n/static/a014788b5837e0ecda1d6e173d4bf6a4/722ed/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-19-2831.jpg 1164w","sizes":"(min-width: 1164px) 1164px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a014788b5837e0ecda1d6e173d4bf6a4/b9c18/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-19-2831.webp 291w,\n/static/a014788b5837e0ecda1d6e173d4bf6a4/e675f/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-19-2831.webp 582w,\n/static/a014788b5837e0ecda1d6e173d4bf6a4/37469/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-19-2831.webp 1164w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1164px) 1164px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1237.1134020618556}}}},"image_secondary":{"id":"e7f0f6e3-fb4b-4156-8590-169820e32d85","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/724766fd440432271a6d80b0bea60133/bb567/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-11-2832.jpg","srcSet":"/static/724766fd440432271a6d80b0bea60133/a4531/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-11-2832.jpg 293w,\n/static/724766fd440432271a6d80b0bea60133/a55b3/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-11-2832.jpg 586w,\n/static/724766fd440432271a6d80b0bea60133/bb567/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-11-2832.jpg 1171w","sizes":"(min-width: 1171px) 1171px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/724766fd440432271a6d80b0bea60133/c0a23/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-11-2832.webp 293w,\n/static/724766fd440432271a6d80b0bea60133/c3f2f/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-11-2832.webp 586w,\n/static/724766fd440432271a6d80b0bea60133/acc40/SOUNDWAVE-GEO-Acoustic-panels-Ineke-Hans-offecct-59003-11-2832.webp 1171w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1171px) 1171px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1229.7181895815543}}}},"tags":["Acoustic Panels"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Offecct","slug":"offecct","image_logo_dark":{"id":"cf96e4ad-cc9c-4d9d-b4fc-2a9dfe5b9d07","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/003fc2532a8b8ba2fe72440a434552df/dark_offecct.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2957"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2704769099"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
