The dividers improve the acoustic qualities of an environment, while at the same time adding interesting dimensions to the room.  \n  \n“These dividers can be seen as a celebration of nature and its beauty and wisdom,” says Jin Kuramuto. “My inspiration always comes from nature. There is nothing more beautiful than a snowflake, a beehive or a leaf. I see these dividers as a forest of organic shapes that also control acoustics, like a kind of tuner, like trees in the forest, making the environment more pleasant and friendly. The dividers should play a supporting role, not symbolic, and very functional.”   \n  \n“I think it is very nice to have the dividers as reminders of nature’s beauty in, say, a hospital or in a large office landscape. They also make it possible to speak in a normal tone of voice even in acoustically chaotic environments. When sitting down in a chair or sofa, the divider feels like a wall. When standing up it can be seen from far away in a room. The heights of the dividers are very carefully calculated.”  \n  \nWind was part of the Offecct Lab collection in 2016 and has been tested extensively in various public meeting places throughout the year. “It’s been fantastic to see how well it has tested in improving acoustic values,” says Anders Englund, Design Manager at Offecct.  \n  ","designer":"Jin Kuramoto","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"d5800dff-8604-492b-9f54-c9d59d54c894","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d3584e91c2accc775906a16f6d588972/02dff/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-8859.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d3584e91c2accc775906a16f6d588972/0fdf4/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-8859.jpg 300w,\n/static/d3584e91c2accc775906a16f6d588972/a89ca/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-8859.jpg 600w,\n/static/d3584e91c2accc775906a16f6d588972/02dff/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-8859.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d3584e91c2accc775906a16f6d588972/078c3/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-8859.webp 300w,\n/static/d3584e91c2accc775906a16f6d588972/6d09e/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-8859.webp 600w,\n/static/d3584e91c2accc775906a16f6d588972/83805/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-8859.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1200}}}},"image_secondary":{"id":"ef37c9f6-dac4-47ca-9e7f-01a5d53a9506","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#686868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1b55c4645550104b05c355df0566ce4a/02dff/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-6521150C-A-8853.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1b55c4645550104b05c355df0566ce4a/0fdf4/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-6521150C-A-8853.jpg 300w,\n/static/1b55c4645550104b05c355df0566ce4a/a89ca/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-6521150C-A-8853.jpg 600w,\n/static/1b55c4645550104b05c355df0566ce4a/02dff/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-6521150C-A-8853.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1b55c4645550104b05c355df0566ce4a/078c3/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-6521150C-A-8853.webp 300w,\n/static/1b55c4645550104b05c355df0566ce4a/6d09e/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-6521150C-A-8853.webp 600w,\n/static/1b55c4645550104b05c355df0566ce4a/83805/WIND-Room-dividers-Acoustic-panels-Jin-Kuramoto-offecct-6521150C-A-8853.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1200}}}},"tags":["Room Dividers"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Offecct","slug":"offecct","image_logo_dark":{"id":"cf96e4ad-cc9c-4d9d-b4fc-2a9dfe5b9d07","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/003fc2532a8b8ba2fe72440a434552df/dark_offecct.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2937"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2704769099"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
