Soundwave® Village is a successful pairing of architecture and design. It has a complicated geometry, in which the sound-absorbent properties have determined the pattern. The Claesson Koivisto Rune and Offecct design team applied acoustics principles to tweak and twist the intricate pattern to achieve the optimal sound absorbency. The pattern of the panel can be described as a view of the roofs of small buildings, thereof the name. The pattern can also be experienced as an abstract—the observer does not have to perceive the building pattern. The panels can be used individually or combined to form a whole wall. All panels absorb weak sounds in the upper frequencies (500 Hz and above). They are perfect for eliminating disturbing reflected sound from voices in office landscapes, telephone conversations, and computer noise, and can be used to improve the sound levels in settings like restaurants.  \n  \n“The facets and trapezoid shapes make the sound rebound at a 45-degree angle. After we had worked on the pattern for a while, we realized it looked like the roofs on a lot of small buildings. To get the right feeling, we looked at aerial photographs of very dense urban areas. The Forbidden City in Beijing, where the spaces between buildings can be extremely narrow, was one source of inspiration.” /Eero Koivisto.  \n  ","designer":"Claesson Koivisto Rune","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"dd2422a6-9335-4e6b-95f5-d3798d8bb222","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#288888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1b03d894704e2f10ab1b4d47a1a8f2eb/38840/SOUNDWAVE-VILLAGE-Acoustic-panels-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-59009-91-2887.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1b03d894704e2f10ab1b4d47a1a8f2eb/9f37f/SOUNDWAVE-VILLAGE-Acoustic-panels-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-59009-91-2887.jpg 297w,\n/static/1b03d894704e2f10ab1b4d47a1a8f2eb/15d02/SOUNDWAVE-VILLAGE-Acoustic-panels-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-59009-91-2887.jpg 594w,\n/static/1b03d894704e2f10ab1b4d47a1a8f2eb/38840/SOUNDWAVE-VILLAGE-Acoustic-panels-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-59009-91-2887.jpg 1188w","sizes":"(min-width: 1188px) 1188px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1b03d894704e2f10ab1b4d47a1a8f2eb/cb462/SOUNDWAVE-VILLAGE-Acoustic-panels-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-59009-91-2887.webp 297w,\n/static/1b03d894704e2f10ab1b4d47a1a8f2eb/4a41c/SOUNDWAVE-VILLAGE-Acoustic-panels-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-59009-91-2887.webp 594w,\n/static/1b03d894704e2f10ab1b4d47a1a8f2eb/a2527/SOUNDWAVE-VILLAGE-Acoustic-panels-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-59009-91-2887.webp 1188w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1188px) 1188px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1192.9292929292928}}}},"image_secondary":{"id":"1b2bc871-abed-4a24-b110-b27f1792d81c","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#484858","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6c8d78d60f391afe07dbfd52b494f359/02dff/NEMO-SOUNDWAVE-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-3097.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6c8d78d60f391afe07dbfd52b494f359/0fdf4/NEMO-SOUNDWAVE-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-3097.jpg 300w,\n/static/6c8d78d60f391afe07dbfd52b494f359/a89ca/NEMO-SOUNDWAVE-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-3097.jpg 600w,\n/static/6c8d78d60f391afe07dbfd52b494f359/02dff/NEMO-SOUNDWAVE-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-3097.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6c8d78d60f391afe07dbfd52b494f359/078c3/NEMO-SOUNDWAVE-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-3097.webp 300w,\n/static/6c8d78d60f391afe07dbfd52b494f359/6d09e/NEMO-SOUNDWAVE-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-3097.webp 600w,\n/static/6c8d78d60f391afe07dbfd52b494f359/83805/NEMO-SOUNDWAVE-Claesson-Koivisto-Rune-offecct-3097.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1200}}}},"tags":["Acoustic Panels"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Offecct","slug":"offecct","image_logo_dark":{"id":"cf96e4ad-cc9c-4d9d-b4fc-2a9dfe5b9d07","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/003fc2532a8b8ba2fe72440a434552df/dark_offecct.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2963"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2704769099"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
