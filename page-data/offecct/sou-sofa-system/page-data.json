Teruhiro Yanagihara’s sofa Sou, designed for Offecct, is constructed in different layers to make it possible to freely create different shapes and functions for public environments.   \n  \nTeruhiro Yanagihara has a background in spatial design and architecture and always thinks about rooms and surfaces, rather than individual   \n  \nobjects. As in his previous collection for Offecct, Osaka, the new Sou sofa is based on a spatial perspective where the furniture works as a flexible jigsaw puzzle.   \n  \n“Since the seat and backrest are separated, you can choose different colours of fabric or different finishes on the table part, for instance” Teruhiro Yanagihara explains.   \n  \nHe also emphasizes the similarity between Japanese and Scandinavian design tradition when it comes to reducing rather than adding to the product. Sou, with its simple shape, is given a timeless and easy-to-place expression, while also being a sustainable design choice with lower consumption of   \n  \nresources and materials.   \n  ","designer":"Teruhiro Yanagihara","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"a4b0fbbe-5bc6-4b13-abac-f787a9601b8e","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0637042c2bb1a8f2e3c952077a333f3c/02dff/Sou-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15783.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0637042c2bb1a8f2e3c952077a333f3c/0fdf4/Sou-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15783.jpg 300w,\n/static/0637042c2bb1a8f2e3c952077a333f3c/a89ca/Sou-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15783.jpg 600w,\n/static/0637042c2bb1a8f2e3c952077a333f3c/02dff/Sou-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15783.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0637042c2bb1a8f2e3c952077a333f3c/078c3/Sou-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15783.webp 300w,\n/static/0637042c2bb1a8f2e3c952077a333f3c/6d09e/Sou-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15783.webp 600w,\n/static/0637042c2bb1a8f2e3c952077a333f3c/83805/Sou-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15783.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1200}}}},"image_secondary":{"id":"ea3f49ee-3e69-4dce-9a33-9f2629278340","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c3c02cb60aac2d5485f1556a1e1c9543/02dff/Sou-Sofa-systems-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15785.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c3c02cb60aac2d5485f1556a1e1c9543/0fdf4/Sou-Sofa-systems-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15785.jpg 300w,\n/static/c3c02cb60aac2d5485f1556a1e1c9543/a89ca/Sou-Sofa-systems-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15785.jpg 600w,\n/static/c3c02cb60aac2d5485f1556a1e1c9543/02dff/Sou-Sofa-systems-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15785.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c3c02cb60aac2d5485f1556a1e1c9543/078c3/Sou-Sofa-systems-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15785.webp 300w,\n/static/c3c02cb60aac2d5485f1556a1e1c9543/6d09e/Sou-Sofa-systems-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15785.webp 600w,\n/static/c3c02cb60aac2d5485f1556a1e1c9543/83805/Sou-Sofa-systems-Teruhiro-Yanagihara-offecct-15785.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1200}}}},"tags":["Sofa Systems"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Offecct","slug":"offecct","image_logo_dark":{"id":"cf96e4ad-cc9c-4d9d-b4fc-2a9dfe5b9d07","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/003fc2532a8b8ba2fe72440a434552df/dark_offecct.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2846"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2823708677"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
