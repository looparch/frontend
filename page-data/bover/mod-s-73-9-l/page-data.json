The petals of its flowers are customizable, being able to adapt to almost all types of materials, smooth , perforated , deployed or drawn and laser cut plates depending on the theme that wants to be used. They also accept natural materials, such as wood panels or natural fibers such as raffia. If we let our imagination run wild, we can crochet them with colored threads. Mods were born to let the fantasy of space creators flow.","designer":"Lázaro Rosa-Violán","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"1ea00ce0-9e44-4be4-810e-da685a56e783","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8b8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6349a99824debe7ee0afee75a61688d1/753ad/Mod-S9L-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/6349a99824debe7ee0afee75a61688d1/1ac30/Mod-S9L-1.jpg 150w,\n/static/6349a99824debe7ee0afee75a61688d1/aad87/Mod-S9L-1.jpg 300w,\n/static/6349a99824debe7ee0afee75a61688d1/753ad/Mod-S9L-1.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6349a99824debe7ee0afee75a61688d1/a070d/Mod-S9L-1.webp 150w,\n/static/6349a99824debe7ee0afee75a61688d1/65d97/Mod-S9L-1.webp 300w,\n/static/6349a99824debe7ee0afee75a61688d1/8cb6d/Mod-S9L-1.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":2088}}}},"image_secondary":null,"tags":["Lighting","Pendant"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Bover","slug":"bover","image_logo_dark":{"id":"7062e86e-d5eb-489f-82e6-323aea825cc6","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4ecae7ec1ed9be1a12797917da140690/dark_bover.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1751"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2823708677"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
