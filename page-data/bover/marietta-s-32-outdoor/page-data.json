The Marietta lamp is contemporary, decorative, warm, and enveloping.\nThe original Marietta is clearly an indoor light but Joana wanted to adapt it for outdoor settings. To do so, the Outdoor version is made from white polyethylene, with which she imitated the texture and wave-like form of the ribbon-shade in the original design. It is a lamp designed for terraces, parasols and pergolas, and also for kitchens, bars and restaurants. It is a perfect go-to for all these spaces: resistant, easy to clean and very versatile. This versatility has to do with the timelessness that Joana is always looking for in her designs. Her works can stand next to classical pieces and with contemporary ones. This ensures they can be incorporated naturally into people's lives.\nThe Marietta Outdoor is, for many reasons, an example of 'slow-cooked' design where non-conformity and Joana's conviction play important roles in creating the best possible final product. \"Every little detail of Marietta Outdoor was thought about a thousand times. Bover takes this precise approach with every lamp they design. This is what separates many products from others. The quality lies not only in the materials but also in the industrial development behind them\", explains Joana. This is why Marietta Outdoor is the best Marietta we have been able to develop.","designer":"Joana Bover","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"cc13fe96-450d-4f7e-9d82-88e9ffc1fc91","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7e5ad4d080c22c2c64994cd1d4c65b50/753ad/marietta-out.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7e5ad4d080c22c2c64994cd1d4c65b50/1ac30/marietta-out.jpg 150w,\n/static/7e5ad4d080c22c2c64994cd1d4c65b50/aad87/marietta-out.jpg 300w,\n/static/7e5ad4d080c22c2c64994cd1d4c65b50/753ad/marietta-out.jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7e5ad4d080c22c2c64994cd1d4c65b50/a070d/marietta-out.webp 150w,\n/static/7e5ad4d080c22c2c64994cd1d4c65b50/65d97/marietta-out.webp 300w,\n/static/7e5ad4d080c22c2c64994cd1d4c65b50/8cb6d/marietta-out.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":2088}}}},"image_secondary":{"id":"c7789ddd-ace7-4cff-9991-af5aaf221769","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f499a89ce5e403f4c486751a2701c531/a0d17/Marietta-Outdoor-Cataleg.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f499a89ce5e403f4c486751a2701c531/15cdc/Marietta-Outdoor-Cataleg.jpg 75w,\n/static/f499a89ce5e403f4c486751a2701c531/293e5/Marietta-Outdoor-Cataleg.jpg 150w,\n/static/f499a89ce5e403f4c486751a2701c531/a0d17/Marietta-Outdoor-Cataleg.jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f499a89ce5e403f4c486751a2701c531/ee8bf/Marietta-Outdoor-Cataleg.webp 75w,\n/static/f499a89ce5e403f4c486751a2701c531/445ab/Marietta-Outdoor-Cataleg.webp 150w,\n/static/f499a89ce5e403f4c486751a2701c531/85424/Marietta-Outdoor-Cataleg.webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":2400}}}},"tags":["Lighting","Pendant"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Bover","slug":"bover","image_logo_dark":{"id":"7062e86e-d5eb-489f-82e6-323aea825cc6","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4ecae7ec1ed9be1a12797917da140690/dark_bover.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1842"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2823708677"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
