The Drip has the Drop'sÂ  structure but has a personality all of its own. It is a lighting system that not only evolves into various product types (wall lights, table lamps, floor lamps with USB connection, among others), but also into other lampshade concepts. The new shade of the Drip gives one the impression of being in the presence of a completely different lamp from the Drop. It embodies the Drip's spirit, simple, minimalist and with straight lines. The Drip's small lampshade is also made from borosilicate glass, giving it a fine, delicate aesthetic. The choice of glass is closely linked to the light it casts, which is bright, but intimate. It creates ambiance while being highly practical for anyone nearby. \"I always keep in mind the space a lamp will be placed in because that is where it has meaning,\" explains Christophe. The design and function of the Drip and Drop fit perfectly into residential projects and contracting work. Because it can be applied in many ways, it works very well in hotels, both in common spaces and in rooms.\n2 options: Cord switch / Proxy Dimmer","designer":"Christophe Mathieu","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"237915a5-4e91-42ff-a780-3c9117581429","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#887868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/48479e4732cb5370e9b47fc49ef44c30/4a263/drip-m36-detalle.jpg","srcSet":"/static/48479e4732cb5370e9b47fc49ef44c30/a6bb8/drip-m36-detalle.jpg 300w,\n/static/48479e4732cb5370e9b47fc49ef44c30/dc8ae/drip-m36-detalle.jpg 600w,\n/static/48479e4732cb5370e9b47fc49ef44c30/4a263/drip-m36-detalle.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/48479e4732cb5370e9b47fc49ef44c30/bb0c8/drip-m36-detalle.webp 300w,\n/static/48479e4732cb5370e9b47fc49ef44c30/4ba8b/drip-m36-detalle.webp 600w,\n/static/48479e4732cb5370e9b47fc49ef44c30/a2704/drip-m36-detalle.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1024}}}},"image_secondary":{"id":"5de9ea6e-391f-464e-906f-311110857368","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#887868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0dff141bd8c0e4e43cdd204361c231a8/4a263/drip-m36-detalle.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0dff141bd8c0e4e43cdd204361c231a8/a6bb8/drip-m36-detalle.jpg 300w,\n/static/0dff141bd8c0e4e43cdd204361c231a8/dc8ae/drip-m36-detalle.jpg 600w,\n/static/0dff141bd8c0e4e43cdd204361c231a8/4a263/drip-m36-detalle.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0dff141bd8c0e4e43cdd204361c231a8/bb0c8/drip-m36-detalle.webp 300w,\n/static/0dff141bd8c0e4e43cdd204361c231a8/4ba8b/drip-m36-detalle.webp 600w,\n/static/0dff141bd8c0e4e43cdd204361c231a8/a2704/drip-m36-detalle.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1024}}}},"tags":["Lighting","Table"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Bover","slug":"bover","image_logo_dark":{"id":"7062e86e-d5eb-489f-82e6-323aea825cc6","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4ecae7ec1ed9be1a12797917da140690/dark_bover.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1821"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2823708677"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
