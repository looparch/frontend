The TRIA frontal parts are made in white lacquer or natural oak and they can be slightly moved to offer a suggestive play of light and shadow around the organic shape of the diffuser. TRIA can be installed either as a single wall light or as a light module with a sole connection point on the wall which makes it easier to be installed in halls, offices and hotel reception desks and lobbies. A dimmable version is available.","designer":"Rubén Saldaña","collection":null,"subtitle":null,"image_primary":{"id":"4d1a83f4-c66f-41bb-91c3-4a95cff2e295","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7c4416484a5ccbe2d57a24c1af68b380/358b2/TRIA_02.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7c4416484a5ccbe2d57a24c1af68b380/a6bb8/TRIA_02.jpg 300w,\n/static/7c4416484a5ccbe2d57a24c1af68b380/0d05e/TRIA_02.jpg 600w,\n/static/7c4416484a5ccbe2d57a24c1af68b380/358b2/TRIA_02.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7c4416484a5ccbe2d57a24c1af68b380/bb0c8/TRIA_02.webp 300w,\n/static/7c4416484a5ccbe2d57a24c1af68b380/51078/TRIA_02.webp 600w,\n/static/7c4416484a5ccbe2d57a24c1af68b380/caa00/TRIA_02.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":1025}}}},"image_secondary":null,"tags":["Lighting","Wall"],"manufacturer":{"title":"Bover","slug":"bover","image_logo_dark":{"id":"7062e86e-d5eb-489f-82e6-323aea825cc6","imageFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4ecae7ec1ed9be1a12797917da140690/dark_bover.svg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1858"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2704769099"],"slicesMap":{"footer":"footer","navbar":"navbar"}}
