Viewing the ceiling from different angles changes the perceived colorfulness. It is impossible to grasp the objects in their entirety at a single glance. Only by changing the angle of view can the colorfulness of the tiles gradually be fully grasped. As soon as the viewer moves, the impression is created that the tiles are changing or transforming.\nFlow was designed to create an interaction between the person and their environment.\n\nDrop the tiles into any 9/16” or 15/16” tee-grid.
